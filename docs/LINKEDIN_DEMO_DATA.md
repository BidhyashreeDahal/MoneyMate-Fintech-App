| 25th       | Public Transit| 28.00 | Monthly pass            |

Use the **current month** for all dates (e.g. March 2025) so Dashboard and AI report show “this month.”

---

## 4. Add transfers (2–3)

**Transfers** → **+ New transfer**:

| From           | To         | Amount | Note           |
|----------------|------------|--------|----------------|
| Main Checking  | Savings    | 500    | Monthly save   |
| Main Checking  | Cash       | 100    | Withdrawal     |

---

## 5. Create budgets (3–4)

**Budgets** → **+ Create budget**. Use **same month** as your transactions (e.g. 1st–28th of current month).

| Category      | Limit (CAD) | Alert at |
|---------------|-------------|----------|
| Groceries     | 400         | 80%      |
| Food & Drinks | 150         | 80%      |
| Subscriptions | 50          | 80%      |
| Shopping      | 200         | 80%      |

After you’ve added the transactions above, **Groceries** will be near or over limit and **Subscriptions** will show good progress — perfect for screenshots (progress bars, “Approaching limit” / “Over budget”).

---

## 6. Optional: receipt + AI report

- **Receipt:** Add one transaction, then **attach a receipt** (image/PDF) and use **Parse receipt** so the “AI receipt” feature shows in the demo.
- **AI report:** Open **Insights** or **Dashboard** and trigger the **Monthly AI report** (if your backend has an AI key). Screenshot the report for LinkedIn.

---

## 7. Screenshot checklist for LinkedIn

- [ ] **Login / Sign up** — clean, branded screen.
- [ ] **Dashboard** — KPIs, chart, recent transactions.

## Quick copy-paste (same month, e.g. March 2025)

- **Accounts:** Main Checking 5000, Savings 12000, Cash 350, Credit Card 0  
- **Income:** Salary 4200, Bonus 500  
- **Expenses:** Mix of Groceries (~403), Food & Drinks (80), Subscriptions (~28), Shopping (90), Utilities (95), Internet (55), etc.
